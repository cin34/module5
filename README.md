Summary

The results suggest a strong positive linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, with a very high p-value indicating a statistically significant association. A lower Standard Error at 1.0249 suggests a relatively tight fit of the regression model. The R-squared value of 0.9034 confirms that the linear model explains a significant portion of the variance in the data and indicates a very strong positive linear relationship between x_values and y_values. A P-value of 0.9999999999999923 is extremely high, indicating that the observed positive association is almost certainly not due to chance. Lastly, the drug regimen of Capomulin has shown to significantly reduce tumor volume (mm3) on average compared to the other drug regimen trials.
